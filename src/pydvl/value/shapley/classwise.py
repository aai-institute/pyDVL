Class-wise Shapley (Schoch et al., 2022)[^1] offers a Shapley framework tailored
for classification problems. Let $D$ be a dataset, $D_{y_i}$ be the subset of
$D$ with labels $y_i$, and $D_{-y_i}$ be the complement of $D_{y_i}$ in $D$. The
key idea is that a sample $(x_i, y_i)$, might enhance the overall performance on
$D$, while being detrimental for the performance on $D_{y_i}$. The Class-wise
value is defined as:

$$
v_u(i) = \frac{1}{2^{|D_{-y_i}|}} \sum_{S_{-y_i}} \frac{1}{|D_{y_i}|!}
\sum_{S_{y_i}} \binom{|D_{y_i}|-1}{|S_{y_i}|}^{-1}
[u( S_{y_i} \cup \{i\} | S_{-y_i} ) − u( S_{y_i} | S_{-y_i})],
$$

where $S_{y_i} \subseteq D_{y_i} \setminus \{i\}$ and $S_{-y_i} \subseteq
D_{-y_i}$.

!!! tip "Analysis of Class-wise Shapley"
    For a detailed analysis of the method, with comparison to other valuation
    techniques, please refer to the [main
    documentation](../../../../../value/classwise-shapley).

In practice, the quantity above is estimated using Monte Carlo sampling of
the powerset and the set of index permutations. This results in the estimator

$$
v_u(i) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_k \frac{1}{L} \sum_l
[u(\sigma^{(l)}_{:i} \cup \{i\} | S^{(k)} ) − u( \sigma^{(l)}_{:i} | S^{(k)})],
$$

with $S^{(1)}, \dots, S^{(K)} \subseteq T_{-y_i},$ $\sigma^{(1)}, \dots,
\sigma^{(L)} \in \Pi(T_{y_i}\setminus\{i\}),$ and $\sigma^{(l)}_{:i}$ denoting
the set of indices in permutation $\sigma^{(l)}$ before the position where $i$
appears. The sets $T_{y_i}$ and $T_{-y_i}$ are the training sets for the labels
$y_i$ and $-y_i$, respectively.

??? info "Notes for derivation of test cases"
    The unit tests include the following manually constructed data:
    Let $D=\{(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(4,1)\}$ be the test set and $T=\{(1,0),(2,0),(3,1),(4,1)\}$
    the train set. This specific dataset is chosen as it allows to solve the model

    $$y = \max(0, \min(1, \text{round}(\beta^T x)))$$

    in closed form $\beta = \frac{\text{dot}(x, y)}{\text{dot}(x, x)}$. From the closed-form
    solution, the tables for in-class accuracy $a_S(D_{y_i})$ and out-of-class accuracy 
    $a_S(D_{-y_i})$ can be calculated. By using these tables and setting 
    $\{S^{(1)}, \dots, S^{(K)}\} = 2^{T_{-y_i}}$ and 
    $\{\sigma^{(1)}, \dots, \sigma^{(L)}\} = \Pi(T_{y_i}\setminus\{i\})$,
    the Monte Carlo estimator can be evaluated ($2^M$ is the powerset of $M$).
    The details of the derivation are left to the eager reader.

class ClasswiseScorer(Scorer):
    r"""A Scorer designed for evaluation in classification problems. Its value
    is computed from an in-class and an out-of-class "inner score" (Schoch et
    al., 2022) <sup><a href="#schoch_csshapley_2022">1</a></sup>. Let $S$ be the
    training set and $D$ be the valuation set. For each label $c$, $D$ is
    factorized into two disjoint sets: $D_c$ for in-class instances and $D_{-c}$
    for out-of-class instances. The score combines an in-class metric of
    performance, adjusted by a discounted out-of-class metric. These inner
    scores must be provided upon construction or default to accuracy. They are
    combined into:

    $$
    u(S_{y_i}) = f(a_S(D_{y_i}))\ g(a_S(D_{-y_i})),
    $$

    where $f$ and $g$ are continuous, monotonic functions. For a detailed
    explanation, refer to section four of (Schoch et al., 2022)<sup><a
    href="#schoch_csshapley_2022"> 1</a></sup>.

    !!! warning Multi-class support
        Metrics must support multiple class labels if you intend to apply them
        to a multi-class problem. For instance, the metric 'accuracy' supports
        multiple classes, but the metric `f1` does not. For a two-class
        classification problem, using `f1_weighted` is essentially equivalent to
        using `accuracy`.

    Args:
        scoring: Name of the scoring function or a callable that can be passed
            to [Scorer][pydvl.utils.score.Scorer].
        default: Score to use when a model fails to provide a number, e.g. when
            too little was used to train it, or errors arise.
        range: Numerical range of the score function. Some Monte Carlo methods
            can use this to estimate the number of samples required for a
            certain quality of approximation. If not provided, it can be read
            from the `scoring` object if it provides it, for instance if it was
            constructed with
            [compose_score][pydvl.utils.score.compose_score].
        in_class_discount_fn: Continuous, monotonic increasing function used to
            discount the in-class score.
        out_of_class_discount_fn: Continuous, monotonic increasing function used
            to discount the out-of-class score.
        initial_label: Set initial label (for the first iteration)
        name: Name of the scorer. If not provided, the name of the inner scoring
            function will be prefixed by `classwise `.

        scores are of the same order of magnitude. This normalization is particularly
        useful when the inner score function $a_S$ is calculated by an estimator of the
        form $\frac{1}{N} \sum_i x_i$, e.g. the accuracy.
