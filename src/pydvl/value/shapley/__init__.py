"""
This package holds all routines for the computation of Shapley Data value. Users
will want to use
[compute_shapley_values][pydvl.value.shapley.common.compute_shapley_values] or
[compute_semivalues][pydvl.value.semivalues.compute_semivalues] as interfaces to
most methods defined in the modules.

Please refer to [the guide on data valuation][data-valuation] for an overview of
all methods.
