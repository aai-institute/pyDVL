Monte Carlo approximations to Shapley Data values.

.. warning::
   You probably want to use the common interface provided by
   :func:`~pydvl.value.shapley.compute_shapley_values` instead of directly using
   the functions in this module.

Because exact computation of Shapley values requires $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$
re-trainings of the model, several Monte Carlo approximations are available.
The first two sample from the powerset of the training data directly:
:func:`combinatorial_montecarlo_shapley` and :func:`owen_sampling_shapley`. The
latter uses a reformulation in terms of a continuous extension of the utility.

Alternatively, employing another reformulation of the expression above as a sum
over permutations, one has the implementation in
:func:`permutation_montecarlo_shapley`, or using an early stopping strategy to
reduce computation :func:`truncated_montecarlo_shapley`.

.. seealso::
   It is also possible to use :func:`~pydvl.value.shapley.gt.group_testing_shapley`
   to reduce the number of evaluations of the utility. The method is however
   typically outperformed by others in this module.

.. seealso::
   Additionally, you can consider grouping your data points using
   :class:`~pydvl.utils.dataset.GroupedDataset` and computing the values of the
   groups instead. This is not to be confused with "group testing" as
   implemented in :func:`~pydvl.value.shapley.gt.group_testing_shapley`: any of
   the algorithms mentioned above, including Group Testing, can work to valuate
   groups of samples as units.

    Instead of naively implementing the expectation, we sequentially add points
    to coalitions from a permutation and incrementally compute marginal utilities.
    We stop computing marginals for a given permutation based on a
    :class:`TruncationPolicy`. :footcite:t:`ghorbani_data_2019` mention two
    policies: one that stops after a certain fraction of marginals are computed,
    implemented in :class:`FixedTruncation`, and one that stops if the last
    computed utility ("score") is close to the total utility using the standard
    deviation of the utility as a measure of proximity, implemented in
    :class:`BootstrapTruncation`.

    We keep sampling permutations and updating all shapley values
