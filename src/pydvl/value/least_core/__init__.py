.. versionadded:: 0.4.0

This package holds all routines for the computation of Least Core data values.

Please refer to :ref:`data valuation` for an overview.

In addition to the standard interface via
:func:`~pydvl.value.least_core.compute_least_core_values`, because computing the
Least Core values requires the solution of a linear and a quadratic problem
*after* computing all the utility values, there is the possibility of performing
each step separately. This is useful when running multiple experiments: use
:func:`~pydvl.value.least_core.naive.lc_prepare_problem` or
:func:`~pydvl.value.least_core.montecarlo.mclc_prepare_problem` to prepare a
list of problems to solve, then solve them in parallel with
:func:`~pydvl.value.least_core.common.lc_solve_problems`.

Note that :func:`~pydvl.value.least_core.montecarlo.mclc_prepare_problem` is
parallelized itself, so preparing the problems should be done in sequence in this
case. The solution of the linear systems can then be done in parallel.

    See :ref:`data valuation` for an overview.

    The following algorithms are available. Note that the exact method can only
    work with very small datasets and is thus intended only for testing.

    - ``exact``: uses the complete powerset of the training set for the constraints
      :func:`~pydvl.value.shapley.naive.combinatorial_exact_shapley`.
    - ``montecarlo``:  uses the approximate Monte Carlo Least Core algorithm.
      Implemented in :func:`~pydvl.value.least_core.montecarlo.montecarlo_least_core`.

    :param u: Utility object with model, data, and scoring function
    :param n_jobs: Number of jobs to run in parallel. Only used for Monte Carlo
        Least Core.
    :param n_iterations: Number of subsets to sample and evaluate the utility on.
        Only used for Monte Carlo Least Core.
    :param mode: Algorithm to use. See :class:`LeastCoreMode` for available
        options.
    :param non_negative_subsidy: If True, the least core subsidy $e$ is constrained
        to be non-negative.
    :param solver_options: Optional dictionary of options passed to the solvers.

    :return: ValuationResult object with the computed values.
