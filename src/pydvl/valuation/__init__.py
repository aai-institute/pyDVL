This module collects methods for data valuation mostly based on marginal utility
computation, approximations thereof or other game-theoretic methods. For a full list,
see [Methods][implemented-methods-data-valuation].

As supporting modules it includes subset [sampling schemes][pydvl.valuation.samplers],
[dataset handling][pydvl.valuation.dataset] and objects to [declare and learn
utilities][pydvl.valuation.utility].
