"""Samplers for Owen Shapley values.

The Owen Shapley value is a sampling-based method to estimate Shapley values. It samples
probability values between 0 and 1 and then draws subsets of the complement of the
current index where each element is sampled with the given probability.

## Possible configurations

The basic sampler is [OwenSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.OwenSampler]. It can
be configured with a deterministic grid of probability values or a uniform distribution
between 0 and 1. The former follows the idea of the original paper (Okhrati and Lipani,
2021)[^1].

This strategy for the sampling of probability values can be specified with the
[GridOwenStrategy][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.GridOwenStrategy] or
[UniformOwenStrategy][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.UniformOwenStrategy] classes.

In addition, and as is the case for all
[PowerSetSamplers][pydvl.valuation.samplers.powerset], one can configure the way the
sampler iterates over indices to be updated. This can be done with the
[IndexIteration][pydvl.valuation.samplers.powerset.IndexIteration] strategy.

When using infinite index iteration, the sampler can be used with a stopping criterion
to estimate Shapley values. This follows more closely the typical usage pattern in PyDVL
than the original sampling method described in Okhrati and Lipani (2021)[^1].

## Antithetic Owen sampling

We also provide an
[AntitheticOwenSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.AntitheticOwenSampler], which
draws probability values $q$ between 0 and 0.5 again, either deterministically over a
discrete grid or at uniformly at random, and then generates two samples for each index,
one with the probability $q$ and another with probability $1-q$.

It can be configured in the same manner as the regular Owen sampler.

???+ Example "The four main configurations"
    ```python
    standard_owen = OwenSampler(
        outer_sampling_strategy=GridOwenStrategy(n_samples_outer=100),
        n_samples_inner=2,
        index_iteration=FiniteSequentialIndexIteration,
        )
    antithetic_owen = AntitheticOwenSampler(
        outer_sampling_strategy=GridOwenStrategy(n_samples_outer=100),
        n_samples_inner=2,
        index_iteration=FiniteSequentialIndexIteration,
        )
    infinite_owen = OwenSampler(
        outer_sampling_strategy=UniformOwenStrategy(seed=42),
        n_samples_inner=2,
        index_iteration=RandomIndexIteration,
        seed=42
    )
    infinite_antithetic_owen = AntitheticOwenSampler(
        outer_sampling_strategy=UniformOwenStrategy(seed=42),
        n_samples_inner=2,
        index_iteration=RandomIndexIteration,
        seed=42
    )

        $$ P (| S_{q_j} | = k) = \binom{n}{k} \  q_j^k  (1 - q_j)^{n - k}.$$

        So, if each $q_j$ is chosen with equal weight (or more generally with
        probability $p_j$),then by total probability, the overall probability of
        obtaining a subset of size $k$ is a mixture of the binomials:
        $$

        In our case $p_j = 1/N$, so that $P(|S|=k) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N P (|
        S_{q_j} | = k)$. For large enough $N$ this is

        Now, given the symmetry wrt. the indices in the sampling procedure, any given
        set $S$ of size $k$ is equally likely to be drawn. So the probability of a set
        being of size $k$ must be equally divided by the number of sets of that size,
        and the weight of a set of size $k$ is:
