"""
This module implements Maximum Sample Re-use (MSR) sampling for valuation, as described
in Wang and Jia (2023)[^1], where it was introduced specifically for
[Data Banhzaf][pydvl.valuation.methods.banzhaf].

!!! Warning
    MSR can be very unstable when used with valuation algorithms other than
    [Data Banzhaf][pydvl.valuation.methods.banzhaf]. This is because of the
    instabilities introduced by the correction coefficients. For more, see Appendix C.1
    of Wang and Jia (2023)[^1].

The idea behind MSR is to update all indices in the dataset with every evaluation of the
utility function on a sample. Updates are divided into positive, if the index is in the
sample, and negative, if it is not. The two running means are later combined into a
final result.

Note that this requires defining a special evaluation strategy and result updater, as
returned by the [make_strategy][pydvl.valuation.samplers.msr.MSRSampler.make_strategy]
and [result_updater][pydvl.valuation.samplers.msr.MSRSampler.result_updater] methods,
respectively.

For more on the general architecture of samplers see
[pydvl.valuation.samplers][pydvl.valuation.samplers].

    This class is used to update two running means for positive and negative updates
    separately. The two running means are later combined into a final result.

    Since values computed with MSR are not a mean over marginals, both the variances of
    the marginals and the update counts are ill-defined. We use the following
    conventions:

    1. The counts are defined as the minimum of the two counts. This definition enables
    us to ensure a minimal number of updates for both running means via stopping
    criteria and correctly detects that no actual update has taken place if one of the
    counts is zero.

    2. We reverse engineer the variances so that they yield correct standard errors
    given our convention for the counts and the normal calculation of standard errors in
    the valuation result.

    Note that we cannot use the normal addition or subtraction defined by the
    [ValuationResult][pydvl.valuation.result.ValuationResult] because it is weighted
    with counts. If we were to simply subtract the negative result from the positive we
    would get wrong variance estimates, misleading update counts and even wrong values
    if no further precaution is taken.
