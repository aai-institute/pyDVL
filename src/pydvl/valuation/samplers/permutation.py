Permutation samplers draw permutations $\sigma^N$ from the index set $N$ uniformly at
random and iterate through it returning the sets:

$$S_1 = \{\sigma^N_1\}, S_2 = \{\sigma^N_1,
\sigma^N_2\}, S_3 = \{\sigma^N_1,\sigma^N_2, \sigma^N_3\}, ...$$

## The probability of sampling a set

!!! warning "Read on below for the actual formula"
    This section describes the general case. However, because of how the samplers are
    used to compute marginals, the effective sampling probabilities are slightly
    different.

Let $k$ be the size of a sampled set $S$ and $n=|N|$ the size of the index set. By the
product rule:

$$p(S) = p(S \mid k) \ p(k).$$

Now, for a uniformly chosen permutation, every subset of size $k$ appears as the
prefix (the first $k$ elements) with probability

$$ p (S \mid k) = \frac{k! (n - k) !}{n!} = \binom{n}{k}^{- 1}, $$

and, because we iterate from left to right, each size $k$ is sampled with probability
$p(k) = 1/n.$ Hence:

$$ p(S) = \frac{1}{n} \binom{n}{k}^{- 1}. $$

The same argument applies to the
[DeterministicPermutationSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.permutation.DeterministicPermutationSampler]
and [PermutationSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.permutation.PermutationSampler], but
also to
[AntitheticPermutationSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.permutation.AntitheticPermutationSampler].
For the latter, note that the sampling process is symmetric.


## The case of a fixed index when computing marginals

However, when computing marginal utilities, which is what the samplers are used for, the
situation is slightly different since we update indices $i$ sequentially. In [Sampling
strategies for semi-values][sampling-strategies-permutations] a more convoluted argument
is made, whereby one splits the permutation by the index $i$. This ends up being similar
to what we found above:

$$ p(S) = \frac{1}{n} \binom{n-1}{k}^{- 1}, $$

Therefore,
[log_weight()][pydvl.valuation.samplers.permutation.PermutationSampler.log_weight]
is valid, **when computing marginal utilities**.
