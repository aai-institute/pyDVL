This module implements the Banzhaf valuation method, as described in
Wang and Jia, (2022)<sup><a href="#wang_data_2023">1</a></sup>.

Data Banzhaf was proposed as a means to counteract the inherent stochasticity of the
utility function in machine learning problems. It chooses the coefficients $w(k)$ of the
semi-value valuation function to be constant:

$$w(k) := 2^{n-1},$$

for all set sizes $k$. The intuition for picking a constant weight is that for
any choice of weight function $w$, one can always construct a utility with
higher variance where $w$ is greater. Therefore, in a worst-case sense, the best
one can do is to pick a constant weight.

Data Banzhaf proves to outperform many other valuation methods in downstream tasks like
best point removal, but can show some
