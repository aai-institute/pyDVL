"""
This module contains the implementations of all valuation methods.

This includes **semi-values**, **model-specific** methods and any related algorithms.
For several of the semi-value methods there are two implementations:

* A generic one combining some of the [available samplers][pydvl.valuation.samplers]
  with a subclass of
  [SemivalueValuation][pydvl.valuation.methods.semivalue.SemivalueValuation] which
  defines a coefficient function.
* A dedicated class that chooses the right sampler to avoid numerical issues when
  computing otherwise necessary importance sampling corrections. You can read more about
  this in [Sampling strategies for semi-values][semi-values-sampling].

    For a full list of algorithms see: [All data valuation methods
    implemented][implemented-methods-data-valuation].
