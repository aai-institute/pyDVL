"""
This module implements Leave-One-Out (LOO) valuation.

This is the simplest example of marginal-contribution-based valuation method. It is
defined as:

$$
v_\text{LOO}(i) = U(I) - U(I \setminus \{i\}),
$$

where $U$ is the utility function, $I$ is the set of all data points, and $i$ is the
data point of interest.

Strictly speaking, LOO can be seen as a [semivalue][pydvl.valuation.semivalue] where the
coefficients are zero except for $k=|D|-1$,
