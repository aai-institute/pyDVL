class LeastCoreValuation(Valuation):
    """Umbrella class to calculate Least Core values with multiple sampling methods.

    See [Data valuation][data-valuation] for an overview.

    Different samplers correspond to different least-core methods from the literature:

    - `DeterministicUniformSampler`: Exact (naive) method. This yields the most precise
        results but is only feasible for tiny datasets (<= 20 observations).
    - `UniformSampler`: Monte Carlo method. This is the most practical method for
        larger datasets.

    Other samplers allow you to create your own method and might yield computational
    gains over a standard Monte Carlo method.

    Args:
        utility: Utility object with model, data and scoring function.
        sampler: The sampler to use for the valuation.
        n_samples: The number of samples to use for the valuation. Can be set
            to None if deterministic samplers with known number of samples (e.g.
            DeterministicUniformSampler) are used.
        If True, the least core subsidy $e$ is constrained
            to be non-negative.
        solver_options: Optional dictionary of options passed to the solvers.
        progress: Whether to show a progress bar during the construction of the
            least-core problem.
