    """Umbrella class to calculate Shapley values with Owen sampling schemes.

    Owen shapley values converge to true Shapley values as the number of samples
    increases but have been shown to need fewer samples than other sampling schemes.

    The number of samples is governed by the sampler object. There are no convergence
    criteria for Owen shapley values as they will just run for a fixed number of
    samples.

    Args:
        utility: Utility object with model and scoring function.
        sampler: Owen sampling scheme to use. Can be OwenSampler or
            AntitheticOwenSampler.
        progress: Whether to show a progress bar.
