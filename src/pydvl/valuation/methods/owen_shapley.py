Owen sampling schemes are a family of sampling schemes that are used to estimate
Shapley values. They are based on a multilinear extension technique from game theory,
and were introduced in (Okhrati and Lipani, 2021)[^1]. The core idea is to use different
probabilities of including indices into samples.

In order to compute values it is enough to use any of the Owen samplers together with a
[ShapleyValuation][pydvl.valuation.methods.ShapleyValuation] object.

## Finite Owen Sampler
[OwenSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.OwenSampler] with a
[FiniteSequentialIndexIteration][pydvl.valuation.samplers.powerset.FiniteSequentialIndexIteration]
for the outer loop and a
[GridOwenStrategy][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.GridOwenStrategy] for the sampling
probabilities is the most basic Owen sampler. It uses a deterministic grid of
probability values between 0 and 1 for the inner sampling. It follows the idea of
the original paper and should be instantiated with
[NoStopping][pydvl.valuation.stopping.NoStopping] as stopping criterion. Note that
because the criterion never checks for convergence, the status of the valuation will
always be `Status.Pending`.

??? Example
    ```python
    from pydvl.valuation import OwenSampler, ShapleyValuation, NoStopping
    ...

    sampler = OwenSampler(
        outer_sampling_strategy=GridOwenStrategy(n_samples_outer=100),
        n_samples_inner=2,
        index_iteration=FiniteSequentialIndexIteration,
    )
    valuation = ShapleyValuation(utility, sampler, NoStopping())
    valuation.fit(dataset)
    shapley_values = valuation.values()
    ```

## Owen Sampler
[OwenSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.OwenSampler] follows the same principle
as [OwenSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.OwenSampler], but samples
probability values between 0 and 1 at random indefinitely. It requires a stopping
criterion to be used with the valuation method, and thus follows more closely the
general pattern of the valuation methods. This makes it more adequate for actual use
since it is no longer required to estimate a number of outer samples required.

!!! Example
    ```python
    from pydvl.valuation import OwenSampler, ShapleyValuation, RankCorrelation
    ...

    sampler = OwenSampler()
    valuation = ShapleyValuation(utility, sampler, RankCorrelation(rtol=1e-3))
    valuation.fit(dataset)
    ```

## Antithetic Owen Sampler
[AntitheticOwenSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.AntitheticOwenSampler] is a
variant of the [OwenSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen.OwenSampler] that draws
probability values $q$ between 0 and 0.5 at random and then generates two samples
for each index, one using the probability $q$ for index draws, and another with
probability $1-q$.

!!! Example
    ```python
    from pydvl.valuation import AntitheticOwenSampler, ShapleyValuation, RankCorrelation
    ...

    sampler = AntitheticOwenSampler()
    valuation = ShapleyValuation(utility, sampler, RankCorrelation(rtol=1e-3))
    valuation.fit(dataset)
    ```
