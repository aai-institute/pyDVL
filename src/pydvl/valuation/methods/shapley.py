This module implements the Shapley valuation method.

!!! info
    See the [main documentation][shapley-valuation-intro] for a description of the
    algorithm and its properties.

We provide two main ways of computing Shapley values:

1. A general approach that allows for **any** sampling scheme, including deterministic,
   uniform, permutations, and so on. This is implemented in
   [ShapleyValuation][pydvl.valuation.methods.shapley.ShapleyValuation]
2. A default configuration for the **Truncated Monte Carlo Shapley** (TMCS) method,
   described in Ghorbani and Zou (2019)[^1]. This is basically a wrapper to the more
   general class, but with a permutation sampler by default. Besides being convenient,
   it allows deactivating importance sampling internally (see [Sampling strategies for
   semi-values][semi-values-sampling]).

Computing values in PyDVL typically follows the following pattern: construct a
[ModelUtility][pydvl.valuation.utility.modelutility.ModelUtility], a
[sampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers], and a
[stopping criterion][pydvl.valuation.stopping], then pass them to the valuation and fit
it.

??? Example "General usage pattern"
    ```python
    from pydvl.valuation import (
        ShapleyValuation,
        ModelUtility,
        SupervisedScorer,
        PermutationSampler,
        MaxSamples
    )

    model = SomeSKLearnModel()
    scorer = SupervisedScorer("accuracy", test_data, default=0)
    utility = ModelUtility(model, scorer, ...)
    sampler = UniformSampler(seed=42)
    stopping = MaxSamples(5000)
    valuation = ShapleyValuation(utility, sampler, is_done=stopping)
    with parallel_config(n_jobs=16):
        valuation.fit(training_data)
    result = valuation.values()
    ```

## Choosing samplers

Different choices of sampler yield different qualities of approximation, see
[Sampling strategies for semi-values][semi-values-sampling] for a discussion of
the internals.

The most basic one is
[DeterministicUniformSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.DeterministicUniformSampler],
which iterates over all possible subsets of the training set. This is the most accurate,
but also the most computationally expensive method (with complexity $O(2^n)$), so it is
never used in practice.

However, the most common one is
[PermutationSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.PermutationSampler], which samples random
permutations of the training set. Despite the apparent greater complexity of $O(n!)$,
the method is much faster to converge in practice, especially when using [truncation
policies][pydvl.valuation.samplers.truncation] to early-stop the processing of each
permutation. As mentioned above, the default configuration of TMCS is available via
[TMCShapleyValuation][pydvl.valuation.methods.shapley.TMCShapleyValuation].

??? Example "Manually instantiating TMCS"
    Alternatively to using
    [TMCShapleyValuation][pydvl.valuation.methods.shapley.TMCShapleyValuation], in order
    to compute Shapley values as described in Ghorbani and Zou (2019)[^1], use this
    configuration:

    ```python
    truncation = RelativeTruncation(rtol=0.05)
    sampler = PermutationSampler(truncation=truncation, seed=seed)
    stopping = HistoryDeviation(n_steps=100, rtol=0.05)
    valuation = ShapleyValuation(utility, sampler, stopping, skip_converged, progress)
    ```

Other samplers introduce different importance sampling schemes for the computation of
Shapley values, like the [Owen samplers][pydvl.valuation.samplers.owen],[^2] or the
[Maximum-Sample-Reuse sampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.MSRSampler],[^3] these can be
both beneficial and detrimental, but the usage pattern remains the same.

!!! warning "Choosing stopping criteria"
    As mentioned, computing Shapley values can be computationally expensive, especially
    for large datasets. Some samplers yield better convergence, but not in all cases.
    Proper choice of a stopping criterion is crucial to obtain useful results, while
    avoiding unnecessary computation.

!!! warning "Bogus configurations"
    While it is possible to mix-and-match different components of the valuation method,
    it is not always advisable, and it can sometimes be incorrect. For example, using a
    deterministic sampler with a count-based stopping criterion is likely to yield poor
    results. More importantly, not all samplers, nor sampler configurations, are
    compatible with Shapley value computation. For instance using
    [NoIndexIteration][pydvl.valuation.samplers.powerset.NoIndexIteration] with a
    [PowersetSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.powerset.PowersetSampler] will not work
    since the evaluation strategy expects samples consisting of an index and a subset of
    its complement in the whole index set.
