"""
This module provides a [Scorer][pydvl.utils.score.Scorer] class that wraps
scoring functions with additional information.

Scorers are the fundamental building block of many data valuation methods. They
are typically used by the [Utility][pydvl.utils.utility.Utility] class to
evaluate the quality of a model when trained on subsets of the training data.

Scorers can be constructed in the same way as in scikit-learn: either from 
known strings or from a callable. Greater values must be better. If they are not,
a negated version can be used, see scikit-learn's
[make_scorer()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).

[Scorer][pydvl.utils.score.Scorer] provides additional information about the
scoring function, like its range and default values, which can be used by some
data valuation methods (like
[group_testing_shapley()][pydvl.value.shapley.gt.group_testing_shapley]) to
estimate the number of samples required for a certain quality of approximation.
