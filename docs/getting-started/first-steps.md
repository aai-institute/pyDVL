# Getting started

!!! Warning
    Make sure you have read [[installation]] before using the library. 
    In particular read about how caching and parallelization work,
    since they might require additional setup.

## Main concepts

pyDVL aims to be a repository of production-ready, reference implementations of
algorithms for data valuation and influence functions. Even though we only
briefly introduce key concepts in the documentation, the following sections 
should be enough to get you started.

* [[data-valuation]] for key objects and usage patterns for Shapley value
  computation and related methods.
* [[influence-values]] for instructions on how to compute influence functions.


## Running the examples

If you are somewhat familiar with the concepts of data valuation, you can start
by browsing our worked-out examples illustrating pyDVL's capabilities either:

- In the examples under [[data-valuation]] and [[influence-values]].
- Using [binder](https://mybinder.org/) notebooks, deployed from each
  example's page.
- Locally, by starting a jupyter server at the root of the project. You will
  have to install jupyter first manually since it's not a dependency of the
  library.

# Advanced usage

Besides the do's and don'ts of data valuation itself, which are the subject of
the examples and the documentation of each method, there are two main things to
keep in mind when using pyDVL.

## Caching

pyDVL uses [memcached](https://memcached.org/) to cache the computation of the
utility function and speed up some computations (see the [installation
guide](installation.md/#setting-up-the-cache)).

Caching of the utility function is disabled by default. When it is enabled it
takes into account the data indices passed as argument and the utility function
wrapped into the [Utility][pydvl.utils.utility.Utility] object. This means that
care must be taken when reusing the same utility function with different data,
see the documentation for the [caching module][pydvl.utils.caching] for more
information.

In general, caching won't play a major role in the computation of Shapley values
because the probability of sampling the same subset twice, and hence needing
the same utility function computation, is very low. However, it can be very
useful when comparing methods that use the same utility function, or when
running multiple experiments with the same data.

!!! tip "When is the cache really necessary?"
    Crucially, semi-value computations with the
    [PermutationSampler][pydvl.value.sampler.PermutationSampler] require caching
    to be enabled, or they will take twice as long as the direct implementation
    in [compute_shapley_values][pydvl.value.shapley.compute_shapley_values].

## Parallelization

pyDVL supports [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for local
parallelization (within one machine) and [ray](https://ray.io) for distributed
parallelization (across multiple machines).

The former works out of the box but for the latter you will need to provide a
running cluster (or run ray in local mode).

As of v0.7.0 pyDVL does not allow requesting resources per task sent to the
cluster, so you will need to make sure that each worker has enough resources to
handle the tasks it receives. A data valuation task using game-theoretic methods
will typically make a copy of the whole model and dataset to each worker, even
if the re-training only happens on a subset of the data. This means that you
should make sure that each worker has enough memory to handle the whole dataset.
