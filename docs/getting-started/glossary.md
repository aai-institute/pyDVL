### Data Utility Learning { #glossary-data-utility-learning }

Data Utility Learning is a method that uses an ML model to learn the utility
function. Essentially, it learns to predict the performance of a model when
trained on a given set of indices from the dataset. The cost of training this
model is quickly amortized by avoiding costly re-evaluations of the original
utility.

correcting for the approximation errors in the eigenvalues of the blocks of the
Kronecker-factored approximate curvature matrix. This correction aims to refine
the accuracy of natural gradient approximations, thus potentially offering
better training efficiency and stability in neural networks.

the smallest set of payoffs to players that cannot be improved upon by any
coalition, ensuring stability in the allocation of value. In data valuation,
it implies solving a linear and a quadratic system whose constraints are
determined by the evaluations of the utility function on every subset of the
training data.

 * [Documentation][monte-carlo-least-core]

### Monte Carlo Shapley  { #glossary-monte-carlo-shapley }

over subsets of the training set. This reduces computation to polynomial time
at the cost of accuracy, but this loss is typically irrelevant for downstream

performance, where the points are removed in order of their value. See

### Shapley Value  { #glossary-shapley-value }

Shapley Value is a concept from cooperative game theory that allocates payouts
to players based on their contribution to the total payoff. In data valuation,
players are data points. The method assigns a value to each data point based
on a weighted average of its marginal contributions to the model's performance 
when trained on each subset of the training set. This requires
$\mathcal{O}(2^{n-1})$ re-trainings of the model, which is infeasible for even
trivial data set sizes, so one resorts to approximations like TMCS.
Introduced into data valuation by [@ghorbani_data_2019].

 * [Implementation][pydvl.valuation.methods.shapley]
 * [Documentation][shapley-value]

### Truncated Monte Carlo   { #glossary-tmcs }

TMCS is an efficient approach to estimating the Shapley Value using a
truncated version of the Monte Carlo method, reducing computation time while
maintaining accuracy in large datasets. Being a heuristic to permutation sampling
in Shapley valuation, it can be implemented by using a
[RelativeTruncation ][pydvl.valuation.samplers.truncation.RelativeTruncation]
for a [PermutationSampler][pydvl.valuation.samplers.permutation.PermutationSampler]
when configuring [ShapleyValuation][pydvl.valuation.methods.shapley.ShapleyValuation].
Introduced by [@ghorbani_data_2019].

 * [Implementation][pydvl.valuation.methods.shapley.ShapleyValuation]
 * [Documentation][permutation-shapley]

### Weighted Accuracy Drop  { #glossary-wad }

WAD is a metric to evaluate the impact of sequentially removing data points on
the performance of a machine learning model, weighted by their rank, i.e. by the
time at which they were removed.
Introduced by [@schoch_csshapley_2022].

CV is a statistical measure of the dispersion of data points in a data series
around the mean, expressed as a percentage. It's used to compare the degree of
variation from one data series to another, even if the means are drastically
different.

A CSP involves finding values for variables within specified constraints or
conditions, commonly used in scheduling, planning, and design problems where
solutions must satisfy a set of restrictions.

### Out-of-Bag

OOB refers to data samples in an ensemble learning context (like random forests)
that are not selected for training a specific model within the ensemble. These
OOB samples are used as a validation set to estimate the model's accuracy,
providing a convenient internal cross-validation mechanism.

### Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge

The [MLRC](https://reproml.org/) is an initiative that encourages the
