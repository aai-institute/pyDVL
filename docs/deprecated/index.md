title: New interface for data valuation
alias: 
  name: deprecation-data-valuation
---

The module [pydvl.value][] and its submodules have been deprecated in favor of
the new interface [pydvl.valuation][]. The new interface is more flexible and
allows for more advanced data valuation techniques. The old interface will be
removed in a future release.
