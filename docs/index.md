# The python library for data valuation

pyDVL collects algorithms for data valuation and influence function computation.
It runs most of them in parallel either locally or in a cluster and supports
distributed caching of results.

If you're a first time user of pyDVL, we recommend you to go through the
[[installation]] and [[first-steps]] guides in the Getting Started section.

If you're looking for a list of implemented methods refer to the
[[methods]] page.
