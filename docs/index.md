# The python library for data valuation

pyDVL collects algorithms for data valuation and influence function computation.
For the full list see [[methods]]. It supports out-of-core and distributed
computation, as well as local or distributed caching of results.

If you're a first time user of pyDVL, we recommend you to go through the
[[installation]] and [[first-steps]] guides in the Getting Started section.
