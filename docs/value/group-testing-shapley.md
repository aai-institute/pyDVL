[Group-testing Shapley][pydvl.valuation.methods.gt_shapley.GroupTestingShapleyValuation]
draws inspiration from group testing ideas and reformulates Shapley value
estimation as a feasibility problem, whose constraints are given by samples of
the utility function. By carefully constructing the sampling distribution, the
solution converges to the true Shapley value.[@jia_efficient_2019]
