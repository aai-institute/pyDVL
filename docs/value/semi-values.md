# Semi-values

SV is a particular case of a more general concept called semi-value, which is a
generalization to different weighting schemes. A **semi-value** is any valuation
function with the form:

$$
v_\text{semi}(i) = \sum_{i=1}^n w(k)
\sum_{S \subset D_{-i}^{(k)}} [u(S_{+i}) - u(S)],
$$

where the coefficients $w(k)$ satisfy the property:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n w(k) = 1,$$

the set $D_{-i}^{(k)}$ contains all subsets of $D$ of size $k$ that do not
include sample $x_i$, $S_{+i}$ is the set $S$ with $x_i$ added, and $u$ is the
utility function.

Two instances of this are **Banzhaf indices** [@wang_data_2022],
and **Beta Shapley** [@kwon_beta_2022], with better numerical and
rank stability in certain situations.

!!! Note
    Shapley values are a particular case of semi-values and can therefore also
    be computed with the methods described here. However, as of version 0.7.0,
    we recommend using
    [compute_shapley_values][pydvl.value.shapley.compute_shapley_values]
    instead, in particular because it implements truncation policies for TMCS.


## Beta Shapley

For some machine learning applications, where the utility is typically the
performance when trained on a set $S \subset D$, diminishing returns are often
observed when computing the marginal utility of adding a new data point.

Beta Shapley is a weighting scheme that uses the Beta function to place more
weight on subsets deemed to be more informative. The weights are defined as:

$$
w(k) := \frac{B(k+\beta, n-k+1+\alpha)}{B(\alpha, \beta)},
$$

where $B$ is the [Beta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function),
and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters that control the weighting of the
subsets. Setting both to 1 recovers Shapley values, and setting $\alpha = 1$,
and $\beta = 16$ is reported in [@kwon_beta_2022] to be a good choice for some
applications. Beta Shapley values are available in pyDVL through
[compute_beta_shapley_semivalues][pydvl.value.semivalues.compute_beta_shapley_semivalues]:

```python
from pydvl.value import *

utility = Utility(model, data)
values = compute_beta_shapley_semivalues(
    u=utility, done=AbsoluteStandardError(threshold=1e-4), alpha=1, beta=16
)
```

See however the [Banzhaf indices][banzhaf-indices] section 
for an alternative choice of weights which is reported to work better.

## Banzhaf indices

As noted in the section [Problems of Data Values][problems-of-data-values], the
Shapley value can be very sensitive to variance in the utility function. For
machine learning applications, where the utility is typically the performance
when trained on a set $S \subset D$, this variance is often largest for smaller
subsets $S$. It is therefore reasonable to try reducing the relative
contribution of these subsets with adequate weights.

One such choice of weights is the Banzhaf index, which is defined as the
constant:

$$w(k) := 2^{n-1},$$

for all set sizes $k$. The intuition for picking a constant weight is that for
any choice of weight function $w$, one can always construct a utility with
higher variance where $w$ is greater. Therefore, in a worst-case sense, the best
one can do is to pick a constant weight.

The authors of [@wang_data_2022] show that Banzhaf indices are more robust to
variance in the utility function than Shapley and Beta Shapley values. They are
available in pyDVL through
[compute_banzhaf_semivalues][pydvl.value.semivalues.compute_banzhaf_semivalues]:

```python
from pydvl.value import *

utility = Utility(model, data)
values = compute_banzhaf_semivalues(
    u=utility, done=AbsoluteStandardError(threshold=1e-4), alpha=1, beta=16
)
```

## General semi-values

As explained above, both Beta Shapley and Banzhaf indices are special cases of
semi-values. In pyDVL we provide a general method for computing these with any
combination of the three ingredients that define a semi-value:

- A utility function $u$.
- A sampling method
- A weighting scheme $w$.

You can construct any combination of these three ingredients with
[compute_generic_semivalues][pydvl.value.semivalues.compute_generic_semivalues].
The utility function is the same as for Shapley values, and the sampling method
can be any of the types defined in [the samplers module][pydvl.value.sampler].
For instance, the following snippet is equivalent to the above:

```python
from pydvl.value import *

data = Dataset(...)
utility = Utility(model, data)
values = compute_generic_semivalues(
  sampler=PermutationSampler(data.indices),
  u=utility,
  coefficient=beta_coefficient(alpha=1, beta=16),
  done=AbsoluteStandardError(threshold=1e-4),
)
```

Allowing any coefficient can help when experimenting with models which are more
sensitive to changes in training set size. However, Data Banzhaf indices are
proven to be the most robust to variance in the utility function, in the sense
of rank stability, across a range of models and datasets [@wang_data_2022]. 

!!! warning "Careful with permutation sampling"
    This generic implementation of semi-values allowing for any combination of
    sampling and weighting schemes is very flexible and, in principle, it
    recovers the original Shapley value, so that 
    [compute_shapley_values][pydvl.value.shapley.common.compute_shapley_values]
    is no longer necessary. However, it loses the optimization in permutation
    sampling that reuses the utility computation from the last iteration when
    iterating over a permutation. This doubles the computation requirements (and
    slightly increases variance) when using permutation sampling, unless [the
    cache](getting-started/installation.md#setting-up-the-cache) is enabled.
    In addition, as mentioned above,
    [truncation policies][pydvl.value.shapley.truncated.TruncationPolicy] are
    not supported by this generic implementation (as of v0.7.0). For these
    reasons it is preferable to use
    [compute_shapley_values][pydvl.value.shapley.common.compute_shapley_values]
    whenever not computing other semi-values.
