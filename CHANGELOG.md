  `ValuationResult` and `Status` with more operations. Some minor issues fixed.
  [PR #252](https://github.com/appliedAI-Initiative/pyDVL/pull/250)
- Fixed a bug whereby `compute_shapley_values` would only spawn one process when
  using `n_jobs=-1` and Monte Carlo methods.
  [PR #270](https://github.com/appliedAI-Initiative/pyDVL/pull/270)
- Bugfix in `RayParallelBackend`: wrong semantics for `kwargs`.
  [PR #268](https://github.com/appliedAI-Initiative/pyDVL/pull/268)

  raises an error for dummy sequential parallel backend with TMCS, clones model
  inside `Utility` before fitting by default, with flag `clone_before_fit` 
  to disable it, catches all warnings in `Utility` when `show_warnings` is 
  `False`. Adds Miner and Gloves toy games utilities
  [PR #247](https://github.com/appliedAI-Initiative/pyDVL/pull/247)
